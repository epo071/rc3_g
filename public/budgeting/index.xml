      <description>AbstractLet’s write the formula chain that calculates the budget.\(\gamma\) is the scalar costbase.\(k\), \(p\), \(q\), \(1\) are k-dimensional vectors, respectively for cost weighting, price, quantity, column-vector of 1’s (where k is the number of cost centres to be distinguished).\(z\), \(b\) are the z-dimensional vectors resp. for budget and observed budget weightings ( where z is the number of budget lines to be distinguished)Formulas\(k\gamma= p * q\) (Hadamart product, element-wise)\(B=bk^T\) plus column-normalization ( a z by k matrix)\(z=Bk\gamma\) (Matrix multiplication)Examplegamma &amp;lt;- 1000b &amp;lt;- purrr::set_names(c(0.</description>

      <description>AbstractCost Centre Budgeting is about expressing the Cost (vector of Cost Centres) in the Budget structure (vector of Cost Elements) with the formula \(z=Bk\gamma\). We take the B-matrix from observation and induce budget lines by multiplication with a given costbase (\(\gamma\)) and a distribution (\(k\)).
NB. A further decomposition can be \(k=p*e\) where \(p\), \(e\) are resp. the price and employee weightings of \(\pi\) (average price) and \(\omega\) (total workforce).</description>
